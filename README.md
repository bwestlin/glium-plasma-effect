# GLium Plasma Effect #

An oldschool graphical plasma effect done in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
with [Glium](https://github.com/tomaka/glium).
It's based on [this](https://rawgit.com/bwestlin/canvas-experiments/master/plasma.html)
which I made in JavaScript previously.

Here's how it looks:

Since the effect needs to manipulate pixels and Glium as an OpenGL wrapper
one way to do it is to manipulate the pixels of a texture and then draw the
texture on the screen. It's most likely not the most efficient way but still a way.

Example with a 2x2 texture:
```
let p_buffer = glium::texture::pixel_buffer::PixelBuffer::new_empty(&display, 4);
p_buffer.write(&[
    (255u8, 0u8, 0u8, 255u8),
    (0u8, 255u8, 0u8, 255u8),
    (0u8, 0u8, 255u8, 255u8),
    (255u8, 255u8, 255u8, 255u8)
  ]);
let texture = glium::texture::Texture2d::empty(&display, 2, 2).unwrap();
texture.main_level().raw_upload_from_pixel_buffer(p_buffer.as_slice(), 0 .. 2, 0 .. 2, 0 .. 1);
texture.as_surface().fill(&target, glium::uniforms::MagnifySamplerFilter::Linear);
```
For full example see: [main.rs](src/main.rs)

## Running ##

It need rust 1.5.0 (beta) or later. Suggestion is to use
[Multirust](https://github.com/brson/multirust) for setting up the Rust toolchain.


How to run with Multirust:
```
multirust override beta
cargo run
```
